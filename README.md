## Baseball Projects
**Predicting MLB Team Wins per Season**<br><br>
This project focuses on predicting MLB team wins using various machine learning techniques in Python. It utilizes Scikit-learn for applying models like K-means clustering and linear regression. The data is loaded from a SQLite database and processed using Pandas for cleaning and exploration, followed by Matplotlib to visualize the key statistics. The goal of this task is to build predictive models for MLB team wins perseason based on team statistics by using historical data.<br><br>

**Projecting MLB Player Wins Above Replacement (WAR)**<br><br>
In this initiative, machine learning models were developed using ridge regression to predict the Wins Above Replacement(WAR) statistic for MLB players. The PyBaseball library was leveraged to extract player statistics from Baseball Reference and FanGraphs. After rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing, the models incorporated historical player performance data, resulting in predictions that were accurate within 0.2 of the standard deviation of the WAR metric.
