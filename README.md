## About Me
I’m a data professional with a strong engineering and analytics background, passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that fuel impactful decisions. With over four years of experience across data engineering, machine learning, and data visualization, I specialize in developing robust data pipelines, optimizing workflows, and building predictive models that unlock the value within large-scale datasets. <br>

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I focused on data-centric courses like Big Data and Data Science. This academic foundation, paired with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, PySpark, and cloud computing, enables me to solve data challenges with a balance of technical precision and strategic insight. <br>

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at a dynamic startup, where I automate data workflows and ensure system reliability. My project portfolio includes optimizing rooftop leak detection systems using image processing and applying advanced statistical modeling to predict MLB team performance. I’m driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems with data, and I’m always seeking new opportunities to create meaningful impact through innovative data solutions. <br>

## Projects
**Predicting MLB Team Wins per Season**<br><br>
This project developed machine learning models to predict the total wins of MLB teams over a season, leveraging historical data from Retrosheet and advanced machine learning techniques. By applying K-means clustering to group teams with similar characteristics and linear regression to predict win totals, the project explored correlations between key performance metrics (batting average, on-base percentage, etc.) and team success. The models provided highly accurate predictions, identifying trends that can guide long-term team strategies and roster building. In addition to statistical predictions, the project includes exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between different performance factors.

**Projecting True Average Speed-Off-Bat**<br><br>
In this project, I addressed the challenge of discrepancies between measurement systems used to record batted ball data, specifically the speed-off-bat metric. By applying a combination of a weighted mean difference approach and linear regression, I developed models that adjusted speed readings across systems to produce an accurate, unified estimate of the true average speed-off-bat for each player. This approach accounted for system biases based on hit type (ground balls, line drives, fly balls, popups) and launch angle. The integration of machine learning helped refine the relationship between key variables and provided more reliable estimates. The adjusted speeds offer a more accurate metric for evaluating hitter performance and allow better comparisons across different measurement tools.

**MLB Pitcher Performance Analysis**<br><br>
This project is a detailed exploration of MLB pitchers' release velocity distribution across multiple innings. The goal was to analyze how velocity fluctuates throughout a game and whether it indicates fatigue or performance consistency. By using Statcast data, I designed a comprehensive tool that visualizes these distributions, breaking down performance inning by inning. The analysis helps identify moments where pitchers may begin to lose velocity, which could suggest fatigue and lead to performance drops. These insights are invaluable for coaching staff to make data-driven decisions on pitcher usage, substitutions, and recovery strategies.

![Pitch-Break](/assets/img/Pitch-Break.png) <br><br>
Highlights: <br>
- Created a data-driven tool to help coaches and analysts understand pitcher fatigue patterns
- Analyzed and processed large volumes of Statcast data, breaking it down into actionable insights
- Revealed inning-based velocity changes that can directly impact pitching strategies during games

**Projecting MLB Player Wins Above Replacement**<br><br>
This project focused on projecting MLB players' Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a key statistic for evaluating player contributions to team success. Using historical player data sourced from Baseball Reference and FanGraphs via the PyBaseball library, I applied ridge regression models to forecast future WAR values. The model incorporated multiple factors like batting statistics, fielding performance, and prior WAR results, resulting in highly accurate projections. The project’s purpose was to aid teams in predicting player contributions and optimizing roster decisions based on anticipated performance trends. This tool can serve general managers, coaches, and analysts during player contract negotiations or trades.
<br><br>

![Speed-Off-Bat](/assets/img/Speed-Off-Bat.png) <br><br>
Highlights: <br>
- Developed a model capable of predicting player WAR within 0.2 standard deviation
- Integrated data from multiple sources to create a holistic picture of player performance
- Produced valuable insights for team decision-makers to assesss future player contributions
